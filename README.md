# ScrollWorks

A desktop carving design tool for Windows, written in Rust. Generate acanthus scrollwork from editable backbones, compose chip-carving patterns, place library leaves and buds, and export designs as SVG at physical millimetre sizes. All generation runs locally, with no AI services and no network access.

## Features

- **Scroll workspace:** grown sweeps and acanthus leaves on editable backbones, with Select (V), Pen (P) and Move/Transform (T) tools.
  - **Construction picker:** single scroll, parent and child, S-scroll, mirrored pair, running border, point of origin and corner, each with seeded variations.
  - **Backbones grown from other backbones:** they join like a leaf root and move with their parent. The fork can be dressed with a collar: an axil leaf lying over the crotch, or a split sheath opening along both stems.
  - **Library:** measured leaf types, terminal buds (husk, trefoil, berry cluster) and saved presets.
  - **Wrapping leaves** laid into a scroll's curl, either generated or taken from the library.
  - **Follow stem**, which bends a placed leaf along the stem it grows from.
  - **Leaf fans:** two or three leaves from one node, sized 100 / 66 / 33.
  - **Layers and carving guides:** over/under layering and carving guides.
- **Chip workspace:** a chip-carving pattern generator with its own preset library.
- **Themes:** Graphite (default), Midnight, Slate, Studio, Paper and Sage.

Layouts save as `.scrollworks` or `.json`, the same format as the earlier browser edition. Old stamped motifs are converted to grown leaves.

## Build

1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs.
2. Run `Build ScrollWorks.cmd`. It writes `build-log.txt` and `ScrollWorks.exe`. The first build downloads libraries and takes several minutes.
3. Run `Test geometry.cmd` for the geometry tests; results go to `test-log.txt`.

On other platforms, use `cargo build --release -p scrollworks` and `cargo test --release -p scroll_core`.

## Layout

- `core/` (`scroll_core`, no dependencies): backbones, grown sweeps, acanthus and library leaves, buds, skeletons, wrapping leaves, joins, layering, carving guides, transforms, chip patterns and SVG export. `tests/` includes golden comparisons against the browser edition's output.
- `app/` (`scrollworks`): the egui desktop program, with menus, tools, canvas, panels, themes, the chip workspace and presets.

Settings and presets are stored in `%APPDATA%\ScrollWorks`.

## Browser edition

The earlier TypeScript/React browser edition is retired. Its source remains in this repository's history, up to commit `e7715db`.

## License and attribution

Project-authored software is licensed under GPL-3.0-only. See LICENSE, COPYING.md, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md and BRANDING.md. Modified distributions must meet the applicable GPL source and notice requirements. Ruffensteint branding does not imply endorsement of forks.

## Limitations

Leaf anatomy and collision handling are still being worked on. Review joins, overlaps and print scaling before carving. Scroll exports are drawing outlines, not machining toolpaths. Passing tests does not certify visual quality.
